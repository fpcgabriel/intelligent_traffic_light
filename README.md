# intelligent_traffic_light
This repository is a complementary part of a degree project carried out at the 'Universidad de las Fuerzas Armadas ESPE', where an intelligent traffic light prototype was designed and built using a NVIDIA Jetson TX1 for image processing with YOLOv4, and an Arduino UNO for fuzzy logic control.
